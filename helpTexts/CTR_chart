CTR - Counter
Counter mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher. It generates the next
keystream block by encrypting successive values of a "counter". The counter can
be any function which produces a sequence which is guaranteed not to repeat
for a long time. To make each message unique, a nonce with the counter value
must be used in each block.
